Our goal is to use features that are logically connected to a passenger's experience without introducing data leakage or unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe following features were selected:\n* **Sentiment_score (Numerical)**: This is the most critical feature. It is a direct quantitative measure of the opinion expressed in the review text. A higher score is expected to strongly correlate with passenger satisfaction.\n* **Traveller_Type (Categorical):** The purpose of travel (e.g., Business, Leisure) can set different expectations for service, comfort, and price, thereby influencing the final satisfaction level.\n* **Class (Categorical):** The cabin class (e.g., Economy, Business) is a primary determinant of the in-flight experience, including seat comfort, service quality, and amenities. It is a powerful predictor of satisfaction.\n* **Verified (Categorical):** This flag indicates the authenticity of the review. It could potentially correlate with more genuine or extreme opinions, making it a useful feature to test.\n* **Start_Location & End_Location (Categorical, High Cardinality):** These features capture the geographical context of the flight. The specific route can influence satisfaction due to factors like flight duration (long-haul vs. short-haul), airport quality, and crew assignments.\n  * **Special Handling:** Due to the high number of unique locations (high cardinality), a standard One-Hot Encoder is unsuitable. We instead use a custom Frequency Encoder, which converts each location into a numerical feature representing its popularity in the dataset. This captures the \"importance\" of a route without creating an excessive number of features.\n\nFeatures Excluded and Why:\n* **Rating:** Excluded to prevent data leakage, as our target variable satisfaction is directly derived from it. Including this would result in a model that appears perfect but is useless for real-world prediction.\n* **Flying_Month & Flying_Year:** These features were initially considered to capture seasonality and long-term trends. However, a data quality check revealed a significant number of missing values, making them unreliable for our model. They were therefore excluded in favor of more complete features.\n* **Route:** While potentially useful, it is redundant now that we are using Start_Location and End_Location. It also suffers from the same high-cardinality issue.\n* **Passenger_Name, Review_content, Review_title:** Excluded as they are identifiers or raw text. The essential information from Review_content has already been captured and quantified in the Sentiment_Score feature.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\n\nclass FrequencyEncoder(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):\n    \"\"\"\n    A custom transformer to encode categorical features by their frequency.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.freq_map_ = {}\n\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\n        # Learn the frequency of each category for each column\n        for col in X.columns:\n            self.freq_map_[col] = X[col].value_counts().to_dict()\n        return self\n\n    def transform(self, X, y=None):\n        X_transformed = X.copy()\n        for col in X.columns:\n            # Map the learned frequencies.
